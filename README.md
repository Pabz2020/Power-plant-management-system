# Power Plant Management System

## Overview
The Power Plant Management System is a console application developed as a group project for the Data Structures and Algorithms module. It utilizes C++ to implement essential data structures (linked lists, stacks) and the Merge Sort algorithm for automated load balancing in a simulated power plant environment.

## Features
- Efficient load balancing through algorithmic solutions
- Utilization of linked lists and stacks for data management
- Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm for optimization

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pabz2020/Power-plant-management-system`
2. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file.

## Usage
After execution, all instructions are provided in the starting menu.
